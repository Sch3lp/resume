## About me

In most interactions I'll always try to react after taking into account the other
persons perspective. But I don't always succeed, particularly when I feel passionate
about something or we're discussing something that ties in to my core values.


Next to _The Responsibility Process_ I use a range of _tools/concepts_ to help guide myself
and my team towards better collaboration and meaningful continuous improvement.


My go to teaching style is coaching instead of being very directive. I'll always revert 
back to coaching after briefly adopting a different style to gain progress.


I have allergic reactions to internal politics, _blame_ and _command & control_ cultures, 
hierarchy heavy organisational structures and not getting enough space for experimentation.

## Technical Experience

I consider myself to be a full-stack, polyglot developer.


Spending the time necessary to talk to the business,


in order to build something that matters,


in an application that has just enough software architecture.


While also taking into account the future developers of the codebase I work on.

Programming Languages
:   **Java:** Years of experience with J2EE, JUnit, Hibernate, 
    Spring (rest, data, security, ...), Jersey, ...

:   **JavaScript:** Thorough knowledge of JavaScript (the good parts),
    popular MV* frameworks (Angular, Aurelia, ...), and NodeJS' ecosystem (NPM, Grunt, ...).

:   **Elm:** A pure Functional Programming language to build web applications
    that I fell in love with and have since started livecoding on Twitch.tv, 
    with episodes reuploaded to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-0Zos25VCU6h6bDiv7bh9w/videos) for posterity.

:   Basic knowledge of **(PL/)SQL**, **HTML**, **CSS**, **Scala**.

Open Source
:   [_SoftwareSandbox_](https://github.com/SoftwareSandbox), a GitHub organisation containing _kickstarting_ repositories
    for various purposes.
:   [CoolQuoteRegistrationSystem](https://github.com/SoftwareSandbox/CoolQuoteRegistrationSystem), a _CQRS_ pun
    without having used _CQRS_, where we tried out Aurelia to build an _SPA_ to revisit funny quotes from our Ventouris team.
    It builds a docker image with a standalone SpringBoot jar serving Aurelia, that can be continuously deployed to Heroku on every successful Travis build.
:   [ng2boot](https://github.com/SoftwareSandbox/ng2boot), a walking skeleton for Angular2 + SpringBoot, 
    which got used on a number of sideprojects on the Ventouris team.
:   Contributed REST endpoint protection to the [Simba OS project](https://github.com/cegeka/simba-os)

Architecture & Design techniques
:   Simon Brown's C4 diagrams, Light-weight Architectural Decision Records, Event Storming, Domain Driven Design, CQRS, Event Sourcing, Clean Code, ...
