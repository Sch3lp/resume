## Experience

February 2015 - now: **Cegeka • Developer/Coach at Ventouris**

_Ventouris_ is a project that aims to facilitate the management of Social Contributions of the self-employed,
for a total of 9 social security funds. It's been running in production since 2009 and comes with a lot 
of challenges. Some technical like redesigning parts of the domain, extracting modules, building RESTful API, etc.
But some cultural challenges as well, like on-boarding junior developers in a very large and sometimes complex
codebase, aligning work ethic, retaining active collaboration with business, applying Lean and KanBan principles
and new best practices with a more conservative management team.

## Technical Experience

My Cool Side Project
:   For items which don't have a clear time ordering, a definition
    list can be used to have named items.

    * These items can also contain lists, but you need to mind the
      indentation levels in the markdown source.
    * Second item.

Open Source
:   List open source contributions here, perhaps placing emphasis on
    the project names, for example the **Linux Kernel**, where you
    implemented multithreading over a long weekend, or **node.js**
    (with [link](http://nodejs.org)) which was actually totally
    your idea...

Programming Languages
:   **first-lang:** Here, we have an itemization, where we only want
    to add descriptions to the first few items, but still want to
    mention some others together at the end. A format that works well
    here is a description list where the first few items have their
    first word emphasized, and the last item contains the final few
    emphasized terms. Notice the reasonably nice page break in the pdf
    version, which wouldn't happen if we generated the pdf via html.

:   **second-lang:** Description of your experience with second-lang,
    perhaps again including a [link] [ref], this time placing the url
    reference elsewhere in the document to reduce clutter (see source
    file). 

:   **obscure-but-impressive-lang:** We both know this one's pushing
    it.

:   Basic knowledge of **C**, **x86 assembly**, **forth**, **Common Lisp**

## Education

2010-2014 (expected)

    *Thesis title: Deep Learning Approaches to the Self-Awesomeness
     Estimation Problem*

2007-2010

## Extra Section, Call it Whatever You Want

* Human Languages:

     * English (native speaker)
     * ???
     * This is what a nested list looks like.

* Random tidbit

* Other sort of impressive-sounding thing you did
